🧭 Objective

Refine the current App.tsx to achieve the final Quiet Technology polish and prepare for Phase 5 (“Attention Architecture – Focus Frame”) integration.
Focus on rhythm, cognitive ease, and internal data clarity.
No new external libraries. Keep layout minimal and silent.

🔧 Functional & UX Improvements

Introduce Task Timeline Awareness

Add a small “Updated X days ago” label under each task title, based on lastUpdated.

Use subtle gray (text-muted-foreground/70, text-xs) typography.

Auto-update when status changes.

Context Switch Counter (Background Metric)

Extend Task type with contextSwitchCount?: number.

Increment this value whenever the task’s status changes.

Do not display it yet — persist silently via localStorage for Phase 5.

Focus Mode Refinement

When active:

Hide the summary bar completely (instead of fading).

Slightly enlarge task title font (text-[1.1rem]).

Add a top “Focus Mode Active” banner (text-xs, bg-muted, text-muted-foreground, rounded, centered).

Persist state as already implemented.

Header Hierarchy & Spatial Balance

Add tracking-tight to main title.

Slightly reduce margin-bottom (mb-1).

Keep subtitle in text-sm text-muted-foreground/80.

Micro-Interaction Consistency

All buttons: transition-all duration-200 ease-out.

All cards: hover:border-foreground/10 hover:shadow-none (to avoid pop).

Filters: reduce padding to px-3 py-1.5 for compact harmony.

Accessibility Enhancement

Add aria-live="polite" to task list container so screen readers announce updates.

Ensure every form label has a corresponding id.

Verify Focus Mode toggle is navigable via keyboard and announces state.

Schema Preparation for Phase 5

Extend Task type to include: focusActiveDuringUpdate?: boolean;
When status changes and focusMode === true, set focusActiveDuringUpdate = true.

Persist silently for Phase 5 data merge.

🎨 Design Principles to Preserve

-No motion or sound.

-Calm contrast, ample negative space.

-Text feels like paper on matte surface.

-“Luxury through simplicity” — clarity is the brand.

✅ Acceptance Criteria

“Updated X days ago” displays accurately under each task title.

Focus Mode hides non-essentials and shows banner.

Context switch counter and focusActiveDuringUpdate fields added and persisted silently.

Typography and whitespace feel calm and uniform.

All ARIA and keyboard requirements pass basic accessibility review.

Once complete, please display the entire updated App.tsx for review.
