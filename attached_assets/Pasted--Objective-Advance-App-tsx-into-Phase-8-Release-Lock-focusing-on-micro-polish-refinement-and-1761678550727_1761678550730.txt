🧭 Objective

Advance App.tsx into Phase 8 – Release Lock, focusing on micro-polish, refinement, and executive readiness.
No new features are to be introduced — this pass ensures performance integrity, typographic equilibrium, and graceful visual stillness across all modes (Focus / Insight / Presentation).

🧩 Implementation Amendments

Visual Rhythm Refinement

Reduce card shadow pop by 50%: replace all hover:shadow-none with hover:shadow-sm transition-shadow duration-200 ease-out.

Slightly increase card breathing room: change p-4 → p-5.

Add consistent vertical rhythm:

Filter bar bottom margin → mb-8.

Section titles → mb-3.

Harmonize border treatment: change all border-border/20 to border-border/30 for gentler tone.

Typography and Hierarchy

Task titles → font-medium (instead of font-semibold) when in Presentation Mode for quieter authority.

Insight overlay headers → text-[13px] font-medium uppercase tracking-wide text-muted-foreground/80.

Cognitive Trace and Presentation Metrics → text-[12px] font-normal tracking-tight leading-snug.

Add consistent leading-relaxed to all paragraph-like text (<p> inside Insight or Trace).

Motion Equilibrium

Synchronize fade-in timing with Insight Overlay:

Change animation duration from 300ms → 250ms.

Add cubic-bezier easing: ease-[cubic-bezier(0.25, 0.1, 0.25, 1)].

Trace Panel toggle should fade rather than snap:

Wrap trace panel in transition opacity: <div className={\`transition-opacity duration-250 ease-[cubic-bezier(0.25,0.1,0.25,1)] \${traceVisible ? 'opacity-100' : 'opacity-0'}\`}>
Consistency Between Modes

Focus Mode and Presentation Mode must share identical background tone (bg-background only, no bg-muted/30 overlays).

When Presentation Mode is active, hide all button hover states (add pointer-events-none and opacity-90).

Ensure exiting Presentation Mode re-enables all interactivity gracefully.

Accessibility & Semantics

Add aria-labelledby linking between headers and panels (e.g., Insight, Trace).

Ensure role="dialog" includes aria-describedby pointing to Insight content container.

Add aria-live="polite" on Presentation Panel summary grid for real-time updates.

Label new task form fields with explicit aria-required="true".

Data Stability & Cleanup

On mount, perform cleanup pass removing any malformed or empty task objects (missing id or title). setTasks((prev) => prev.filter(t => t.id && t.title));
If traceData.tasksUpdatedToday exceeds 999, cap it to 999+ for UI stability.

Subtle Brand Signature (Final Touch)

Add a non-intrusive footer line (below Trace Panel): <div className="text-[10px] text-muted-foreground/50 text-center py-1 tracking-widest uppercase">
  Delegate Lens · v1.0 · Cognitive Clarity Suite
</div>
Include only in Presentation Mode; ensure it does not overlap Trace Panel.

🎨 Design Principles to Preserve

Maintain quiet-luxury minimalism; no color intensity changes.

Motion must support perception, not decoration.

Every pixel and frame serves comprehension and calm.

Preserve zero noise, zero distraction flow.

client/src/App.tsx

✅ Acceptance Criteria

Typography and motion feel cohesive, balanced, and understated.

Presentation Mode transitions are smooth and reversible.

Accessibility labels and ARIA roles pass testing with no console warnings.

Task list and metrics remain visually still and stable under rapid updates.

The interface radiates “executive calm” — fully production-ready aesthetic.
