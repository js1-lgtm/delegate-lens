🧭 Objective

Apply the final design polish and semantic clarity amendments before release lock.
Focus: visual coherence and improved status readability.

🎯 Amendments

✅ “Done” Status Visual Enhancement

Update the Done status color mapping in statusColorMap to display in green tones instead of gray. Done: {
  badge: "bg-green-50 text-green-600 dark:bg-green-950/30 dark:text-green-400",
  icon: CheckCircle2,
  iconColor: "text-green-500",
},
This aligns visual perception of completion with positive cognitive reinforcement.

👥 Display Assignee Name Prominently on Task Cards

On each task card, display the assignee’s name clearly underneath the title, even outside of the badge — to improve at-a-glance accountability.

Modify the relevant JSX section (currently shows the small badge {task.assignee}) as follows: <div className="flex flex-col gap-1 ml-4 mb-2">
  <span className="text-[13px] font-medium text-muted-foreground/80">
    Assigned to: <span className="text-foreground font-semibold">{task.assignee}</span>
  </span>
  <span className="text-xs font-medium px-3 py-1 rounded-full bg-muted text-muted-foreground border border-border/30 w-fit">
    {task.assignee}
  </span>
</div>
Ensure consistent spacing (ml-4 mb-2) and that this appears below the task title, but above the status selector.

🌿 Verify Green Palette Contrast

Confirm that the new green tones (text-green-600, dark:text-green-400) pass WCAG AA contrast on both light and dark backgrounds.

If insufficient contrast is detected, bump saturation slightly (text-green-700 / dark:text-green-300).

✅ Acceptance Criteria

“Done” badges and icons appear in a calm, readable green.

Each task card clearly shows “Assigned to: [Name]” in a readable, balanced hierarchy.

No layout disruption to grid flow or spacing.

Color and spacing changes propagate consistently across all modes (focus / presentation / insight).

No warnings or regressions in console.
