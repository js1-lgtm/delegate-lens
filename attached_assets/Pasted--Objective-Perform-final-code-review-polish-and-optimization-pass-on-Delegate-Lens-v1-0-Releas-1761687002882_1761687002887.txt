ðŸ§­ Objective

Perform final code review, polish, and optimization pass on Delegate Lens v1.0 (Release Candidate R1).
This version is functionally and visually complete â€” this pass ensures total release stability, visual polish, and accessibility perfection before tagging v1.0.0.

ðŸ§© Final Review & Refinement Directives
1. ðŸ§¹ Code Consistency & Cleanup

Run Prettier across the file to normalize indentation, quotes, and spacing.

Confirm there are no unused imports or unreferenced hooks (useRef, useCallback, etc.).

Verify all TypeScript checks pass under strict mode â€” no implicit any types or nullable misuses.

Confirm no console.log or console.error outputs remain in production paths.

2. âš¡ Performance & Behavior

Validate that all debounced saves (100 ms) function correctly â€” no redundant re-renders on state changes.

Check that the Focus Mode, Trace Panel, Insight Overlay, and Presentation Mode toggle transitions are smooth (â‰¤ 200 ms).

Confirm that the daily reset logic for traceData and the 7-day expiry for insightData both trigger correctly by simulating date rollovers.

3. ðŸŽ¨ Visual Alignment & Polish

Verify that all cards (.bg-card) render with consistent shadow depth (shadow-sm â†’ hover:shadow-md) and spacing uniformity.

Ensure text contrast meets WCAG AA â€” particularly muted foregrounds and red/green indicators.

Check that Low Priority (green) and High Priority (red) color contrast ratios exceed 4.5:1.

In Presentation Mode, verify typography scaling: headers (â‰ˆ 1.05 rem), metrics (14 px), footer (10 px).

Confirm that all fade-in transitions (@keyframes fadeIn) render smoothly without layout jank.

4. â™¿ Accessibility & Keyboard Navigation

Confirm all ARIA attributes are valid:

role="region" on task grid

aria-live="polite" for updates

aria-modal="true" on overlays

Verify that focus trapping inside the Insight Overlay works reliably with both Tab and Shift+Tab.

When overlays are open, ensure background UI is inert (non-tabbable).

Ensure that pressing Esc sequentially closes overlays â†’ exits presentation mode â†’ returns to default view (no stuck state).

5. ðŸ§ª Functional Validation Checklist

âœ… Task creation (with custom assignee names)

âœ… Status updates and trace increments

âœ… History toggling and rendering (last 3 entries)

âœ… Focus Mode toggle persistence

âœ… Insight Overlay generation and auto-refresh logic

âœ… Presentation Mode merged dashboard behavior

âœ… LocalStorage restore and data retention across reloads

6. ðŸ§¾ Build & Version Tagging
