🧭 Objective

Advance the current App.tsx implementation into Phase 5 – Attention Architecture Integration, extending functionality for calm, data-aware introspection.
Preserve the silent, paper-like luxury interface.
Focus on invisible intelligence: context awareness, reflection, and light data surfacing — not noise.

🔧 Functional and UX Improvements

Add “Cognitive Trace Panel” (Phase 5 Preview Area)

At the bottom of the page, add a discreet collapsible panel titled “Cognitive Trace.”

This panel displays three live metrics aggregated from all tasks:

Average context switch count (rounded).

Number of tasks updated while Focus Mode was active.

Total tasks updated today.

Panel default state: collapsed → tap or click “Trace” button in footer to toggle.

Keep visual design minimalist: text-xs text-muted-foreground bg-muted/30 border-t border-border/40 rounded-t-lg px-4 py-3.

Persist collapsed/expanded state via localStorage (delegate-lens-trace-visible).

Implement Automatic Daily Reset Logic for Today Counters

Add internal variable lastTraceDate (store in localStorage).

If the stored date ≠ today’s date, reset “tasks updated today” to 0.

Increment counter every time a task status changes.

Enhance Task Lifecycle Memory

Extend Task type with history?: { date: string; oldStatus: string; newStatus: string }[].

On every status change, append a record to history.

Do not render yet — store silently in localStorage.

This will enable timeline visualization in Phase 6 (“Focus Frame Insight”).

Visual and Typographic Micro-Adjustments

Slightly reduce card border radius (rounded-lg instead of rounded-xl).

Add subtle card separator rule between title and meta (border-t border-border/30 mt-3 pt-2).

Adjust title font weight to font-semibold for sharper legibility on large displays.

Ensure focus mode enlargement still respects these adjustments.

Accessibility and Keyboard Finalization

Add aria-controls and aria-expanded to the Trace toggle button.

Ensure Escape key closes Trace panel when open.

Add hidden <h2> section headers for assistive navigation (“Task Board”, “Cognitive Trace”).

Data Structure Preparation for Attention Architecture Merge

Introduce top-level const TRACE_KEY = "delegate-lens-trace-data".
