🧭 Objective

Refine the current App.tsx implementation of Delegate Lens to align with the original Quiet Technology / High-Net-Worth Solutions Provider design philosophy.
Do not introduce unnecessary animations, third-party APIs, or backend calls.
Focus only on clarity, calmness, and autonomy.

🔧 Functional Improvements to Implement

Add “New Task” Creation Flow

Create a lightweight “New Task” button placed at the top-right above the summary bar.

When clicked, open a minimal inline form (not a modal) with three fields: Title, Assignee, Status (drop-down).

On submit, append the new task to the list and automatically persist to localStorage.

Form resets after submission.

Improve Status Label Consistency

Replace the hard-coded string logic with a statusColorMap object to keep Tailwind classes consistent across cards and filters.

Ensure “Blocked” uses a softer red tint (e.g., bg-red-50 text-red-600) to maintain “quiet” visual tone.

Streamline Summary Bar Visual Hierarchy

Slightly reduce padding (px-3 py-1.5) and font size of the status counts.

Ensure counts remain in one row on desktop and wrap gracefully on mobile.

Remove excessive borders; keep a single subtle divider (border-border/50).

Add Subtle Focus Feedback for Dropdowns

Use a soft ring (focus:ring-1 focus:ring-ring/50) when editing status or adding tasks.

Maintain accessibility (visible keyboard focus).

Prepare for Future Delegation Depth

Update the Task type to include an optional priority?: string field (default = "Normal").

Do not yet display it, only update the schema for future extension.

🎨 Design Principles to Preserve

Keep spacing generous and typography calm.

Maintain a black-white-gray-neutral palette with minimal accent color.

No animations, loaders, or floating panels.

“Luxury through simplicity.”

📁 Files to Edit

client/src/App.tsx
(Add small supporting components within the same file if necessary.)

✅ Acceptance Criteria

User can add new tasks inline without leaving the dashboard.

All tasks persist via localStorage.

Summary bar, filters, and cards update immediately after new task creation.

Visual hierarchy and quiet style are preserved.

No breaking of Tailwind or TypeScript types.
