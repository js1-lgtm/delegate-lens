🧭 Objective

Evolve App.tsx from Focus Frame Insight into Phase 7 — Unified Quiet Suite, completing the first full-cycle release candidate.
Maintain all calm-interface and cognitive-clarity foundations while introducing Presentation Mode for executive use.

🔧 Functional & UX Amendments

Introduce “Presentation Mode” (Final Layer)

Add a subtle toggle button labeled “Present” (CheckCircle2 icon) beside Insight.

When active:

Hide all UI controls except the task grid and metrics (Trace Panel visible by default).

Enlarge typography slightly (text-[1.05rem] titles).

Apply a gentle fade-in animation on each card (transition-opacity duration-300 ease-out).

Display header text only as: Delegate Lens · Executive Overview
Persist state in localStorage("delegate-lens-presentation-mode").

Escape key exits Presentation Mode.

Merge Trace and Insight Panels During Presentation

When Presentation Mode is on:

Combine Trace Metrics + Focus Frame Insight into a single composite panel at bottom center.

Layout two columns:
Left: Trace metrics.
Right: Insight summary (topSwitchTasks[0], mostRecentTask, and total switches).

Typography: text-xs text-muted-foreground tracking-tight leading-snug.

Micro-Refinements for Calm Hierarchy

Slightly increase card corner radius → rounded-xl.

Change muted gray borders to border-border/20 for softer edges.

Reduce vertical spacing between sections by 8 px.

In Trace and Insight panels, align text left for readability in executive contexts.

Accessibility & ARIA Completeness

Add role="dialog" and aria-modal="true" to Insight overlay.

Add role="status" to Trace Panel metrics container for live updates.

Ensure Presentation Mode toggles announce state via aria-pressed.

Performance & Data Integrity Enhancements

On mount, check for old trace/insight data > 7 days and clear automatically.

Debounce localStorage writes (150 ms) to reduce I/O on rapid status changes.

Optional Visual Cue for Focus Flow

Add a subtle animated underline (scale-x transition) on the active filter button.

Keep understated (opacity-30).

🎨 Design Principles to Preserve

Animation ≤ 300 ms with ease-out.

Maintain neutral palette and quiet rhythm.

Typography > color for emphasis.

No new icons or hues introduced.

All components remain accessible and keyboard-navigable.
