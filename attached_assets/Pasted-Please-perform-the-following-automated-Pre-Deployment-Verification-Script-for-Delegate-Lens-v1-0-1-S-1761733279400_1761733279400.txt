Please perform the following automated Pre-Deployment Verification Script for Delegate Lens v1.0.1 Stable.

Objective: confirm readiness for deployment after recent UI refinements (Assignee Role + Name and Top-Left Task Ordering).

Execute these verification steps exactly as described below:

───────────────────────────────
🧩 SECTION 1 — Data Creation & Display

1️⃣ In the running app, create a new task using the “New Task” button.
   • Set Role → “Assistant”
   • Set Name → “Sarah”
   • Title → “Prepare vendor contract summary”
   • Status → “In Progress”
   • Priority → “High”

2️⃣ Confirm that the new task card immediately appears at the **top-left** of the dashboard grid.

3️⃣ Verify the label on the task card reads:
   Assigned to: Assistant (Sarah)

───────────────────────────────
💾 SECTION 2 — Persistence & Reload

4️⃣ Refresh the browser tab (simulate reload).
   • Confirm the same task reappears with all fields intact.
   • Confirm “Assigned to: Assistant (Sarah)” still displays.

───────────────────────────────
🔄 SECTION 3 — Status & History Logic

5️⃣ Change that task’s status sequentially:
   “In Progress” → “Done” → “Blocked”.

6️⃣ Click “View History”.
   • Confirm history now lists those status changes in order, with timestamps.

───────────────────────────────
📊 SECTION 4 — Metrics & Insights

7️⃣ Click “Insight”.
   • Verify overlay opens and displays:
     – “Top 3 Tasks by Context Switch”
     – “Most Recently Updated”
     – “Total Switches”
   • Close overlay via “Close Insight” button.

8️⃣ Enter “Presentation Mode”.
   • Verify Trace Metrics and Focus Insights panels render correctly.
   • Exit presentation mode again.

───────────────────────────────
📱 SECTION 5 — General Functionality

9️⃣ Confirm page responsiveness by resizing the window; cards re-flow cleanly in grid.

🔟 Open DevTools → Application → Local Storage.
   • Verify that tasks include both `assigneeRole` and `assigneeName` keys.
   • Confirm no “undefined” values appear.

───────────────────────────────
✅ RESULT EXPECTATION

If all steps above succeed without console errors, mark build as:

Delegate Lens v1.0.1 · Stable · Pre-Deployment Verification PASSED.
