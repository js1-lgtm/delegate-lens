🧭 Objective

Refine the current App.tsx implementation of Delegate Lens to elevate the Quiet Technology / High-Net-Worth Solutions Provider experience.
Do not change architecture, routing, or external dependencies.
Focus on sensory clarity, effortless flow, and emotional calm.

🔧 Functional & Visual Improvements to Implement

Implement Task Priority Indicator

Extend the priority field (High, Normal, Low).

Display a small colored dot or label next to each task title (e.g., red for High, gray for Normal, blue for Low).

Add a priority selector to the New Task form.

Persist priority via localStorage.

Introduce Subtle Focus Mode (Toggle Quiet View)

Add a small button in the header (e.g., 🕯 icon or text “Focus Mode”).

When activated, dim non-essential UI (summary bar and filter buttons fade to 50% opacity).

Maintain functionality but visually reduce clutter — simulate executive focus.

Save focus-mode state to localStorage.

Refine Layout Consistency

Make card padding uniform (p-5) and reduce hover shadow to hover:shadow-sm.

Replace hard border-border/50 with border-muted for softer contrast.

Ensure summary counts use the same font size and weight across statuses.

Enhance Keyboard Accessibility & Flow

Ensure all interactive elements (New Task, filters, dropdowns) are reachable via Tab order.

Add aria-labels to interactive buttons for screen reader clarity.

Preserve the “calm UX” principle — no visible outline except subtle focus ring.

Prepare for Cross-Prototype Integration (Attention Architecture)

Add a non-visible lastUpdated: string field to each task (schema only, do not render).

This will later enable context-switch logging for the “Attention Architecture” prototype.

🎨 Design Principles to Preserve

Quiet palette (white / gray / slate) and ample breathing space.

No animations, loaders, or notifications.

Maintain “Luxury through Simplicity.”

All new features should disappear into the experience, not announce themselves.

📁 File to Edit

client/src/App.tsx
(Optionally split into components/TaskCard.tsx if needed for clarity.)

✅ Acceptance Criteria

New priority system implemented and persisted.

Focus Mode toggle works and persists across sessions.

Layout and typography remain balanced and minimal.

Accessibility compliance without breaking visual silence.

lastUpdated field added to schema for future cross-prototype use.

Once finished, please display the complete updated App.tsx for review.
