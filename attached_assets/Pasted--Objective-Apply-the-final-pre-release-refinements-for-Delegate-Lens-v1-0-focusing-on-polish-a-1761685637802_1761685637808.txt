🧭 Objective

Apply the final pre-release refinements for Delegate Lens v1.0 — focusing on polish, accessibility, performance hygiene, and cohesive presentation fidelity.
These changes prepare the build for production sign-off.

🧩 Implementation Amendments
1. 🧼 General Code Hygiene & Readability

Run Prettier or equivalent formatting across the file to ensure consistent indentation and quote style.

Confirm there are no unused imports (useCallback, useRef, etc.) and no console warnings in build.

Confirm that strict TypeScript mode yields no errors.

2. ⚡ Performance & Debounce Efficiency

Replace all current 150 ms debounce delays with 100 ms for smoother UI updates while maintaining efficiency. debounce((...), 100)
Verify that no redundant re-renders occur when toggling focusMode, traceVisible, insightVisible, or presentationMode.

3. 🎨 Visual & UX Refinements

Add a slight shadow to the main cards for improved depth contrast: className="bg-card border border-border/30 p-5 rounded-xl shadow-sm hover:shadow-md transition-shadow duration-200 ease-out"
In presentation mode, slightly increase font size for key metrics (bottom panel): text-[13px] -> text-[14px]
(only within the .grid-cols-2 presentation metrics section).

Add cursor-default to non-interactive text metrics (to avoid the text-selection flicker).

4. ♿ Accessibility & ARIA Validation

Ensure all ARIA labels use proper verbs and referents (e.g., “Enter presentation mode”, “Exit presentation mode”, “Close insight overlay”).

Add role="region" and aria-label="Task board" to the task grid container for enhanced screen reader navigation: <div
  className="grid gap-6 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3"
  role="region"
  aria-label="Task board"
  aria-live="polite"
>
Verify that when overlays are open, background elements are inert (not tabbable).

5. 💾 Data Consistency Check

Ensure daily reset logic for traceData is tested by simulating date change — confirm that values reset cleanly.

Verify that insightData correctly regenerates after 7 days (no stale data in localStorage).

6. 🪞 Branding & Version Tag

Update the footer line in presentation mode to include the build number and release tag: Delegate Lens · v1.0 · Cognitive Clarity Suite · Release Candidate R1
Confirm this text is centered and uses tracking-widest text-muted-foreground/50. ✅ Acceptance Criteria

No lint, console, or TypeScript errors.

All visual states (normal, focus, insight, presentation) behave consistently with smooth transitions.

Overlay accessibility and keyboard navigation are confirmed functional.

LocalStorage persistence and daily reset work as expected.

Presentation mode reads and looks refined (metric readability, spacing, visual calm).

Footer includes correct version tag and aesthetic alignment.
