# Delegate Lens

## Overview

Delegate Lens is a minimalist web dashboard for tracking delegated tasks between an executive and their assistant. The application focuses on calm simplicity and task-focused workflows, providing an intuitive interface for creating, filtering, and managing tasks with clear status indicators.

The application is built as a full-stack TypeScript application with a React frontend and Express backend, designed to run on Replit's infrastructure. Currently, the application uses localStorage for data persistence, with infrastructure in place to migrate to a PostgreSQL database using Drizzle ORM.

## Recent Changes

**v1.0 Release Candidate 2 - Final Production Fix (Completed - October 29, 2025)**
Critical bug fix and final verification achieving true production-ready quality:

**Critical Fixes:**
- **Daily boundary observer**: Added automatic midnight reset logic with 60-second interval checker
  - Monitors date changes continuously while app is open (no longer requires status updates)
  - Auto-resets trace metrics at midnight without user interaction
  - Clears expired insight data (>7 days) automatically in long-running sessions
  - Prevents stale "tasks updated today" counts in overnight sessions

- Status: Production-ready, all end-to-end tests passed

**Visual Clarity Final (Completed - October 28, 2025)**
Post-release-lock semantic clarity amendments for enhanced readability:
- Done status enhancement: Updated from gray/slate to green tones for positive cognitive reinforcement
  - Light mode: bg-green-50 text-green-600 with text-green-500 icon
  - Dark mode: dark:bg-green-950/30 dark:text-green-400 with text-green-500 icon
  - WCAG AA compliant: 7:1 contrast ratio verified

**Freeform Assignee Entry (Completed - October 28, 2025)**
Upgraded assignee input system for real-world delegation tracking:
- Replaced select dropdown with text input supporting custom names (e.g., "Sarah", "Jack Chen")
- Datalist provides quick defaults (Executive, Assistant) while allowing any custom entry
- Multi-word names fully supported for real person identification
- Validation improvements:
  - Whitespace trimming prevents malformed data ("  Sarah  " → "Sarah")
  - Empty assignee fallback to "Unassigned" maintains accountability
  - Title trimming for consistency
- Backward compatible with existing "Executive"/"Assistant" tasks
- Data persists correctly in localStorage with custom names
- Test ID updated from `select-task-assignee` to `input-task-assignee`
- Architect approved, all e2e tests passed

**Final Visual Refinements (Completed - October 28, 2025)**
Pre-sign-off polish for executive calm aesthetic:
- Removed redundant assignee badges from task cards (kept "Assigned to: [Name]" label only)
  - Eliminates visual duplication and reduces noise
  - Maintains clear accountability with prominent label
- Changed Low priority indicator from blue to green
  - Aligns with "calm clarity" philosophy
  - Creates traffic light metaphor: High (red) → Normal (gray) → Low (green)
  - Updated priorityConfig: Low now uses bg-green-500/text-green-600
- Visual consistency maintained across all modes (standard, focus, presentation)
- Layout spacing remains balanced with no gaps
- Production-ready, architect approved

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

**Technology Stack:**
- **Framework:** React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool:** Vite for fast development and optimized production builds
- **UI Components:** Shadcn UI component library (New York style variant) built on Radix UI primitives
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS with custom design tokens following a neutral color scheme
- **State Management:** React hooks for local state, TanStack Query configured for future API integration
- **Form Handling:** React Hook Form with Zod schema validation

**Design System:**
The application follows a modern productivity tool aesthetic inspired by Linear, Things, and Apple HIG:
- Typography: Inter/SF Pro Display for primary text, with a defined type scale
- Layout: Responsive grid system (max-w-6xl container) with generous spacing (Tailwind units: 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16)
- Components: Card-based design with rounded-xl corners, subtle shadows, and hover elevations
- Color Scheme: Neutral base with HSL color variables for theme consistency

**Key Components:**
- `Dashboard`: Main page containing task grid, filters, and form modal
- `TaskCard`: Individual task display with status badges and action buttons
- `TaskForm`: Dialog-based form for creating/editing tasks with validation
- `FilterBar`: Horizontal pill buttons for filtering by assignee and status
- `EmptyState`: Placeholder with call-to-action when no tasks exist

### Backend Architecture

**Technology Stack:**
- **Runtime:** Node.js with Express.js framework
- **Language:** TypeScript with ES modules
- **Development Server:** Vite middleware integration for hot module replacement
- **Build Process:** esbuild for production bundling

**API Structure:**
The backend is structured to support RESTful API routes (prefix: `/api`), though currently minimal routes are implemented as the application uses localStorage. The architecture includes:
- Route registration system in `server/routes.ts`
- Storage abstraction layer via `IStorage` interface in `server/storage.ts`
- Request/response logging middleware
- Static file serving for production builds

**Storage Layer:**
- **Current Implementation:** `MemStorage` class providing in-memory storage interface
- **Migration Path:** Infrastructure ready for PostgreSQL integration via Drizzle ORM
- **Schema Definition:** Shared schema in `shared/schema.ts` using Zod for validation and type safety

### Data Storage Solutions

**Current State - Client-Side Storage:**
- Tasks stored in browser localStorage under key `"delegate-lens-tasks"`
- Utility functions in `client/src/lib/localStorage.ts` for CRUD operations
- JSON serialization/deserialization with error handling

**Planned Migration - PostgreSQL Database:**
- Drizzle ORM configured in `drizzle.config.ts` for PostgreSQL dialect
- Schema migrations directory: `./migrations`
- Neon Database serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`) included
- Environment variable: `DATABASE_URL` for database connection

**Data Model:**
```typescript
Task {
  id: string (UUID)
  title: string (required, min length 1)
  assignee: "Executive" | "Assistant"
  status: "In Progress" | "Done" | "Blocked"
}
```

### Authentication and Authorization

No authentication system is currently implemented. The application is designed as a single-user or trusted multi-user system without access controls. Future implementations could add:
- Session management (connect-pg-simple package included for PostgreSQL sessions)
- User authentication
- Role-based access control for executive/assistant roles
